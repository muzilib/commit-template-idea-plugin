# Git commit template Plugin for IntelliJ

I really like using this submission template plug-in, but the original project has stopped being maintained, so I cloned
it and made modifications. Welcome to use it!
[Original project link](https://github.com/MobileTribe/commit-template-idea-plugin.git)

This plugin allows to create a commit message with the following template:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

From the contribution guidelines of the Angular
project [here](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format).

## Installation

Install directly from the IDE plugin manager (File > Settings > Plugins > Browser repositories > Git Commit Template)
